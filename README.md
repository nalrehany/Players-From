# Thank the College
What we have here consists of 3000+ American and European players to play in the ABA and NBA with players born from 1915 to 1997.
Using the wonderful combination of R and Tableau once again, this map shows the hometowns of players that have cumulatively scored more than 10,000 points (USA) and 1000 (Europe) in their careers, then attributes those totals back to the city. Plenty of cities are between the 10,023-100,000 range in the US, but few can boast their status in the 200,000+ club: Philadelphia, DC, Chicago area, New York's boroughs, LA, and Detroit!
And for Europe: Wurzburg, Barcelona, and Paris, take the cake! I bet some of you basketball junkies can guess the handful of players who contributed.

Enjoy.
## What Was Used

* R
* tidyverse
* dplyr
	
## Key Steps
* Filtering players by 10,000 cumulative points for the USA and 1000 for Europe, given the fact that a disproporionate amount of players come from the former.

## PDF 
* The PDF present provides a fun visual representation of the analysis!
